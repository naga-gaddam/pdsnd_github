### Project Title
Explore US BikeShare Data and produce statistics using Python

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
We will be presented with few data samples across 3 cities in .csv format and using the sample data, statistics needs to be computed as below 

######1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

 * most common month
 * most common day of week
 * most common hour of day

######2 Popular stations and trip

 * most common start station
 * most common end station
 * most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

######3 Trip duration

 * total travel time
 * average travel time

######4 User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### Files used
The required files for running this program in Python are: 

* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv

The files should be placed in the same folder where the Python code is available
